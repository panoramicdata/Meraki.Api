# Contributing to the Meraki API project

First of all, thanks for helping!

The "main" branch is used for generating builds that are released and all contributions should be
provided on branches with a pull request into "main".

For example, if you want to fix an enum that has new entries, you could create appropriate hotfix 
branch "hotfix/network-enum-updates" 
or feature "feature/adding-new-endpoints" 
with the changes on and then create a pull request 
to "main" with the changes.

We make regular updates to keep in sync with new releases and try to get round to 
requests as soon as we can, resourcing allowing.
